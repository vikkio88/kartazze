# Kartazze
A little Orm/QueryBuilder lib experiment with Kotlin.
Tried a few, [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed), [ActiveJDBC](https://javalite.io/activejdbchttps://javalite.io/activejdbc), [Norm](https://github.com/dieselpoint/norm) and I hated them all.

I decided as an experiment to build one myself.
